# epicgameslauncher
I hope to make this app faster at launching games than the official epic games store app, which takes ages to do literally anything.

This app uses React, TailwindCSS, and Electron.

## Installation
There aren't any built binaries yet, but when that does happen it'll probably be over in the releases tab.

## Development

Download the code from the repository

``` git clone https://github.com/Colep14/epicgameslauncher.git```

``` cd epicgameslauncher ```

Install node modules

``` npm install ```

Start the development server

``` npm start ```

You can start the electron and react servers individually with `npm run electron` and `npm run react-browserless` respectively.
